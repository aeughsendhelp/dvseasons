<h1>Derail Valley Seasons</h1>
<p>
	was originally just winter but someone wanted autumn so here we go
</p>

<h1>how tf does this work</h1>
<p>
	dv uses a microsplat shader which allows it to have cool blending and anti-tiling effects. this mod replaces the original texture2darrays with new ones loaded from assetbundles. i havent done it yet but im gonna have to patch the trees to make them snowy and remove the decidious trees's leaves
