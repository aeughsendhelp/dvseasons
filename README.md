<h1>Derail Valley Winter</h1>
<p>
	it's winter time and so heres a winter mod
</p>

<h1>how tf does this work</h1>
<p>
	dv uses microsplat, and i hate microsplat, except not entirely anymore. its actually a pretty neat system, albeit really painful to mod. This mod just loads a new texture 2d array and then applies it to the terrain material.
